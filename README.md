# Blacksmith
A program for viewing, extracting, and converting textures and 3D models from Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, Assassin's Creed: Origins, and Steep. It is in early stages, and this repo will be updated constantly with additional support.

`For now, only viewing and extraction of textures from Assassin's Creed: Odyssey is supported.`

### Remember ARchive_neXt?
Blacksmith serves as a successor to ARchive_neXt, because development has seemingly ceased, and does not support the two latest Assassin's Creed games or Steep. I intended for functionality to be identical to ARchive_neXt.

## Supported Games
PC versions only of:
- Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
- Assassin's Creed: Origins
- Steep (eventually)

## Functionality
- Viewing and extraction of:
  - .forge files
  - 3D models (conversion to: .obj)
  - textures (conversion to: .dds, .png)

## Building
You will need:
- Visual Studio 2017
- .NET Framework 4.6
