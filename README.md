# Blacksmith
A program for viewing, extracting, and converting textures and 3D models from Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, Assassin's Creed: Origins, and Steep. It is in early stages, and this repo will be updated constantly with additional support.

`Note: Blacksmith is NOT a repacker.`

----

***For now, only (texture extraction) from Assassin's Creed: Odyssey and Origins is supported.***

### Remember ARchive_neXt?
Blacksmith serves as a successor to ARchive_neXt, since development has seemingly ceased, and does not support the two latest Assassin's Creed games or Steep. I intended for functionality of Blacksmith to be identical of that of ARchive_neXt.

## Supported Games
PC versions only of:
- Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
- Assassin's Creed: Origins
- Steep (eventually)

## Functionality
- Once this project picks up, the goals are: viewing and extraction of:
  - .forge files
  - 3D models (conversion to: .obj, .dae)
  - textures (conversion to: .dds, .png)
- Also:
  - creation of filelists from .forge files
  - extract all from .forge files
  
## Downloads
[Found here.](https://github.com/theawesomecoder61/Blacksmith/releases) I built a x64 version of Blacksmith, only because these three games are x64 only.
