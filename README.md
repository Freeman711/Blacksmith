# Blacksmith
A program for viewing, extracting, and converting Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, Assassin's Creed: Origins, and Steep textures and 3D models. It is in early stages, and this repo will be updated constantly with additional support.

`For now, only texture viewing and extraction of Assassin's Creed: Odyssey textures is supported.`

## Remember Anvil_NeXT?
Blacksmith serves as a successor to Anvil_NeXT, because development has seemingly ceased. I intended for functionality to be identical to Anvil_NeXT.

## Supported Games
PC versions only of:
- Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
- Assassin's Creed: Origins
- Steep (eventually)

## Functionality
- Viewing and extraction of:
  - .forge files
  - 3D models (conversion to: .obj)
  - textures (conversion to: .dds, .png)

## License
Blacksmith is licensed under the MIT License.

## Building
You will need:
- Visual Studio 2017
- .NET Framework 4.6
